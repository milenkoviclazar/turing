# Turing Machine Simulator

My initial idea was to make a simulator of a Turing machine that will use drawn state diagrams instead of written ones. 

Live demo can be found [here](https://milenkoviclazar.github.io/turing/).

## Getting Started
Just download the repository and open the index.html in your browser.

## TODOs
Add code editor to describe states.

Add sidebar for help in order to increase the space available on the page.

Create several examples.

Allow user to create his own alphabet.
